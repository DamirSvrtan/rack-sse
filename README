Really simple server that generates events as per the HTML5 Server-Sent Events spec.

http://dev.w3.org/html5/eventsource/

To try it out:

$ git clone git://github.com/magnetised/rack-sse.git
$ cd rack-sse
$ bundle install
$ bundle exec thin start

Then goto http://localhost:3000 in your browser.

Anything you type at the prompt should appear in your browser window(s).

This uses rack-async to keep multiple connections open without stressing the server.
